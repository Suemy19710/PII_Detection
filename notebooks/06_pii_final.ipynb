    "Target & Task:\n",
    "- (Old) Target = has_PII (binary classification: contains PII vs. no PII)\n",
    "- (New) Target = PII_Types (show what is the type of PII in the raw text)\n",
    "- Dataset: PII Detection Dataset (from Kaggle) & Customer Support Twitter dataset \n",
    "- Task: Detect PII in customer support conversations using different embedding methods\n",
    "\n",
    "(Old) Features:\n",
    "- TF-IDF embeddings (5000 dimensions, sparse representation)\n",
    "- Word2Vec embeddings (100 dimensions, trained on corpus)\n",
    "- Transformer embeddings (384 dimensions, using all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n",
    "- Combined embeddings (5484 dimensions total)\n",
    "(New) Features:\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings from Hyperparameter Optimization:\n",
    "- Best parameters for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM (Not done yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Baseline:\n",
    "- Majority class accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Reliability:\n",
    "- Train vs Test gap = [Z]% → [stable/overfit/underfit]\n",
    "- Cross-validation stability: [std dev of F1 across folds]\n",
    "- Model generalizes [well/poorly] to unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Based on Findings:\n",
    "- Choose [Transformer + Random Forest / TF-IDF + Logistic Regression] because [reasoning]\n",
    "- Metric focus: [F1-score for balanced view / Recall to minimize false negatives / Precision to reduce false alarms]\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Subjective Reflections\n",
    "What surprised you:\n",
    "- \"I was surprised that [GloVe couldn't distinguish polysemy / Combined embeddings didn't always win / \n",
    "  Simple TF-IDF performed competitively with transformers]\"\n",
    "- \"Unclear: Why [Word2Vec performed poorly on small polysemy examples / SVM was slower than expected]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Design choices that could introduce bias:\n",
    "- Regex-based PII detection may miss [names, non-English PII, context-dependent sensitive info]\n",
    "- TF-IDF max_features=5000 might exclude rare but important PII indicators\n",
    "- Training Word2Vec on Twitter data captures informal language but may not generalize to formal documents\n",
    "- Class imbalance (if severe) biases model toward majority class predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "What to try next with more time:\n",
    "- Fine-tune BERT specifically on PII detection task (instead of just using pretrained embeddings)\n",
    "- Experiment with ensemble methods (voting, stacking) across embedding types\n",
    "- Test on real labeled PII dataset (not regex-based) to validate true performance\n",
    "- Analyze which PII types each embedding method detects best (emails vs. names vs. IDs)\n",
    "- Try preprocessing variations: stemming, lemmatization, different tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "How this helps stakeholders:\n",
    "- \"Customer support teams can automatically flag messages with PII for review before logging\"\n",
    "- \"Reduces privacy violations by detecting sensitive information in real-time\"\n",
    "- \"Helps compliance with GDPR/privacy regulations by identifying data requiring special handling\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight to explain differently:\n",
    "- To teammate: \"Think of embeddings as different 'lenses' - TF-IDF sees keywords, Word2Vec sees \n",
    "  semantic neighbors, Transformers see context-dependent meanings\""
